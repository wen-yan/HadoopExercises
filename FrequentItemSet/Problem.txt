Calculate the frequest item set in records. For example, we have following records (each number represents an item)

{1,2,3,4} 
{1,2,4} 
{1,2} 
{2,3,4} 
{2,3} 
{3,4} 
{2,4} 

so the frequent item set is 
{1,2} 3 
{1,3} 1 
{1,4} 2 
{2,3} 3 
{2,4} 4 
{3,4} 3 
{2,3,4} 2

the last number is item set frequency.
